## How to make concepts maps for each chapter?
The homework here is to make a concept map for each chapter after watching the [lectures](./LECTURES.md). Whenever possible, your concept map should be divided into the [topics of the chapter](./LECTURES.md). In order to receive full points, each concept map should contain all of the key concepts/ideas discussed in the lectures.
