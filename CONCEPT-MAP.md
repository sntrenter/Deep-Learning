## How to make concepts maps for each chapter?
The homework here is to make a concept map for each chapter after watching the [lectures](./LECTURES.md). Whenever possible, your concept map should be divided into the [topics of the chapter](./LECTURES.md). In order to receive full points, each concept map should contain all of the key concepts/ideas discussed in the lectures.

## What to submit?
The concept maps you submit will be visible to the rest of the class but you can see others' submission only after you have posted yours. You are welcome to submit your concept map in any standard format such as a Word Document or a PDF. But please do submit (upload) an image (screenshot) of your concept map so the rest of the class can see it without having to click any links.
